I have spent 5 minutes for this file, so better READ it ;-) !!
I have seen many different versions of so called 'explorer'
examples for VB, but just few of them (one actually) is really
good. This small code shows many ways to manage files, mostly
API and simple VBA. The code is totaly free, and you can do with it
what ever you want, just put me in aboutbox (web address).
But, I didn't know how to add clipboard support, if ya know
tell me by email, and also if you have some suggestions. And HOW
to add listitems to LW (with icons), without listimage object ????
It would be a lot faster to copy icon directly from file (hdc, or 
what ever), instead adding it to imagelist !
I've needed 1.5 days to make this, so freely email me for comments
and suggestions.
If there are bugs, have a look at ERRORS.LOG file !!!
And starting path is "C:\", in Form_Load !
